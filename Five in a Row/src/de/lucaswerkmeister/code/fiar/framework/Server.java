/**
 * The game server.
 * <p>
 * The server handles all game logic. It decides whether a move is legal, keeps track of the game, and notifies the
 * {@link Client}s about any events.
 * <p>
 * All methods of the server are meant to be called by a client; the first argument of each method call should always be
 * the calling instance.
 * <p>
 * The server's behavior when encountering an unknown client as requester is unspecified, but the
 * {@link UnknownClientException} class is provided for uniform behavior if servers wish to throw such an exception.
 * <p>
 * If, for any reason (e.â€¯g., the client "spams" the server with requests), the server decides to "fire" a client, the
 * preferred way for it to do so is to throw a {@link ClientFiredException}.

	 * Phases represent states of the game like "initialization" or "placing stones" (for a complete list, see below).
	 * Each phase can have sub-phases; the value <code>{1,1,3,8}</code> therefore represents "Phase 1.1.3.8" or
	 * "Sub-Phase 8 of Sub-Phase 3 of Sub-Phase 1 of Phase 1"

	 * <li>Version 0:
	 * <ol start="0">
	 * <li>Initialization</li>
	 * <ol start="0">
	 * <li>Choose board size. This phase ends as soon as all players have proposed the same board size.</li>
	 * <li>Block fields. This phase ends as soon as all players have indicated that they are happy with the current
	 * distribution of blocked fields.</li>
	 * <li>Set Joker fields. This phase ends as soon as all players have indicated that they are happy with the current
	 * distribution of Joker fields.</li>

	 * <li>One player won. The sub-phase of this phase gives the winner's ID.</li>

	 * game - the server can, for example, choose to continue the game, and if only one player is left, declare this
